# Hotel Reservation System

This project is a simple hotel reservation system made using Java. It uses swing for the GUI and MySQL for the database.

This project showcases the following OOP concepts:

- Encapsulation: Data and methods are encapsulated within classes, promoting modularity and data integrity.
- Inheritance: Classes are organized into a hierarchical structure, allowing for code reuse and polymorphism.
- Polymorphism: Different object types can be treated as a common superclass, enabling flexible and dynamic behavior.
- Abstraction: Complex systems are simplified by focusing on essential features and hiding implementation details.

Design Considerations

- Modularity: The system is divided into well-defined modules, each with specific responsibilities.
- Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented to prevent unexpected behavior.
- Data Validation: Input validation ensures data integrity and prevents invalid entries.
